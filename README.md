The application offers a user-friendly interface to explore, select, and visualize the combination of components that make up their ideal bicycle - with expert feedback being provided in a user friendly format to ensure you can build the bike of your dreams!


<h3>Features</h3>

**Component Selection**: Users can browse through a variety of available components categorized by type and select their preferred ones.

**Customization Options**: Each component category offers various customization options, enabling users to fine-tune their selections based on preferences, budget, and specifications.

**Visualization** (stretch): The application provides a visual representation or render of the bicycle as users make their component selections, offering a real-time preview of the customized bike.

**Save and Share**: Users can save their configurations for future reference or to compare multiple builds at the same time depending on budget.
